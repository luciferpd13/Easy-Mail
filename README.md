# Easy-Mail(Voice-Based Email Services)
Easy-Mail is a Web-Based Application which is developed by using frontend + backend languages(HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, PHP, PhpMyAdmin). The Major aim of the project is to provide speech to text services to its users also reliable and better security than other email services. Easy Mail strongly applies the concept of Database Normalization, SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle). 

1. The Easy-Mail is similar to other email services where the user has to signup and login to send messages and receive it.
2. Now in Easy-Mail,
          (i)The user will be able to speak messages by using Easy-mail speech to text recognizer, which will increase the speed as the                  user will be speaking rather than typing.
          (ii)Gmail allows users to send only 500 messages per day here is the proof:-  https://support.google.com/mail/answer/22839?hl=en               but in Easy-Mail users will be able to send unlimited messages.

How Easy-Mail Spam Algorithm is Better then Gmail?   

Q.1  Now why Gmail has set a limit to 500 messages?

   Ans- The Reason is to avoid spam. Consider a scenario where the spammer made the bot which is willing to send continuous messages to any email. In this case, two probabilities will occur
Either your Mail-Server will crash because it won't be able to handle continues traffic from the bot.
 Or if your mail-server is strong & if it will be able to handle large traffic then in the second probability the user will receive continuous emails and he no longer will be able to use his email account.
    
 Q.2  How to solve the above problem and allow the user to send unlimited messages?
 
  Ans- There is a very simple algorithm to solve this problem and that we will use in Easy-Mail                                                                                   
In Easy-Mail the user will be able to send unlimited messages but if he is willing to send more then 100 messages to any single email he will be blocked for a day to send emails to that particular email. This approach is much better than Gmail 500 message limit approach.
